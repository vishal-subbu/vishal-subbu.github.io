## Waterfall graphic print

This project was done as a part of Envisage. Envisage is a student run Techno-Cultutral show part of Shaastra. 
This was a group effort where we ideated, designed and fabricated a device that creates pattern by controlling the flow of water. We used solenoid valves which was controlled by an Arduino. The solenoid valves were placed at a height. The Arduino took an image as an input and switched the Solenoid valve on or off based on the input. This controlled switching of the valves produced beautiful patterns as the water fell down. I oversaw the coding aspects of the project which required Image processing, Arduino programming. I was also involved in the electronics part like circuit design and printing. The video of this in action can be seen  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viiuwjyTfl4&t=191s)

## Augumented Reality 

This project was a part of Computer Vision Group (IITM). 
We learnt the basics of image processing and expermented on algorithms for object detection. We tried to superimpose a no-smoking sign over a pre-defined shape. 
We implemented object detection, transforamtions and image additions using rotuines avaiable in [OpenCV](https://opencv.org). The codes that were developed were able to identify the relevant pattern in the image even among various other objects.
