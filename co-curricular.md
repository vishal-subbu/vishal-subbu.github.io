## Waterfall graphic print

This project was done as a part of Envisage. Envisage is a student run Techno-Cultutral schow part of Shaastra. 
This was a grout effort where we ideated, designed and fabricated a device that creates pattern by controlling the flow of water. I oversaw the coding aspects of the project which required Image processing, Arduino programming. I was also involved in the electronics part like circuit design and printing. 

The video of this in action can be seen  [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viiuwjyTfl4&t=191s)
