My research interests are:

1) Integrated Computational Materials

2) Multiscale modelling of materials

3) Phase-field Modelling

4) High performance computing

5) Additive Manufacturing

6) Computational Fluid Dynamics


Currently, I'm working with Prof. Gandham Phanikumar and Dr. Abhik Choudhury to model the heat transfer during Laser-based additive manufactring process using OpenFOAM.


I am looking for Phd positions in computational materials science to work from the fall 2019.
