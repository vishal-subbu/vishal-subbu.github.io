I am a final year student at [IIT Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in/), pursuing Dual Degree(B.Tech & M.Tech) in [Metallurgical and Materials Engineering](https://mme.iitm.ac.in). 

I am interested in the domain of **Compuational Materials Engineering**. I plan to pursue a doctrate in this field of study. I would like to develop algorithms and models to understand materials better. My current research experience includes working with Phase field models, CFD and high perfomance computing. 

This is my personal website where I document my research and internship activities.
Please feel free to grow through my website!
