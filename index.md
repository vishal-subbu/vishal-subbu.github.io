I am a final year student at [IIT Madras](http://www.iitm.ac.in/), pursuing Dual Degree(B.Tech & M.Tech) in Metallurgical and Materials Engineering. 

I am interested in the domain of **Compuational Materials Engineering**. 
I plan to pursue a doctrate in this field of study. I would like to develop algorithms and models to predict properties or model processes. My current research experience includes working with Phase field models and CFD.
